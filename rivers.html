                    1980/81. The first rafting expedition was in Feb 1981 and the party was composed of Nick Hershenow,
                    Sharon Hester, Jerry Kaufman (all USA) and Rudy Koller (Canada). Sharon Hester and Nick Hershenow
                    were rafting guides for Michael Kaye of CREAR. This expedition used a 3.7 metres (12 ft) Avon
                    Redshank and Rudy mostly kayaked in a Holloform.</p>

                <p class="second_lower">The Tully River rises in the Cardwell Range, part of the Great Dividing Range on
                    the northern boundary of the Kirrama State Forest. The river flows generally north through Lake
                    Koombooloomba and flows over the Tully Falls near Ravenshoe and descends through the Tully Gorge
                    within the Tully Gorge National Park, part of the UNESCO World Heritage–listed Wet Tropics site.
                    Below the dam wall, the river is joined by five minor tributaries before emptying into the Coral Sea
                    at Tully Heads. The river descends 800 metres (2,600 ft) over its 133-kilometre (83 mi) course.</p>

                <p class="third_lower">The Zambezi River (also spelled Zambeze and Zambesi) is the fourth-longest river
                    in Africa, the longest east-flowing river in Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean
                    from Africa. The area of its basin is 1,390,000 square kilometres (540,000 sq mi), slightly less
                    than half of the Nile's. The 2,574-kilometre-long river (1,599 mi) rises in Zambia and flows through
                    eastern Angola, along the north-eastern border of Namibia and the northern border of Botswana, then
                    along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe to Mozambique, where it crosses the country to empty
                    into the Indian Ocean.</p>

                <p class="fourth_lower">The Futaleufú River is fed by a chain of lakes in the Los Alerces National Park
                    in Chubut Province, Argentina. The name, Futaleufú, is given to the river below the Futaleufú Dam
                    and Amutui Quimey Reservoir. The watershed drains the Southern Andes Mountains from Argentina into
                    Chile and drains into Yelcho Lake. From this point the river is renamed Rio Yelcho and continues to
                    its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. From its source in Argentina, the river flows 35 kilometres (22 mi)
                    to the Chilean border and enters the Palena Province, in Los Lagos Region. Whitewater
                    enthusiasts generally paddle the Chilean side of the river.</p>
